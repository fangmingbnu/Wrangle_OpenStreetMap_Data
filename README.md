There has some map data in the OSM format from website. I develop python code to read the data and audit the data to remove the outlier.  Then I export the data as csv file and import into SQLite. Through SQLite query command, I obtain the statistical information such as how many nodes in the dataset. Besides that, I use SQL command query to obtain some further information such as top 10 restaurants, or top 10 popular bank in a special area. Finally, through SQL analysis, a comprehensive business report about the gas station, movie, etc. in this map is obtained, which is a good business reference in this area. 

1:The report file is included in the pdf file
2:The link to the map position wrangled in this project, a short description of the area and a reason for my choice is included in the pdf file.
3:The python code to audit the data and import data from xml to csv is included in a text file named "data".
4:A sample named "sample.osm" is included.
